Sure, I can help you understand the given code snippets.

The first snippet is a TypeScript code block that defines two functions: `getToToken` and `getFromToken`. These functions are used to get the token balances for a specific address. The code uses the `big.js` library for handling large numbers, which is commonly used in blockchain development. The function `getToToken` calculates the token balance of an address using the `balances` object from the state, while `getFromToken` calculates it using the contract's storage slot and key hash.

The second snippet contains some JavaScript code blocks with comments about a web application's user interface elements (UI). It appears to be discussing different UI components like buttons, modals, and tables:
- The comment about "Button" suggests that there might be an issue with button functionality in this context; it could mean that buttons do not work as expected or are not properly implemented. 
- "Modal" implies some modal dialogs or popups might be malfunctioning; they could either fail to appear when necessary or have unexpected behavior upon interaction (e.g., closing instead of opening). 
- "Table" indicates problems with table display or functionality within this UI system; tables may have poor formatting, missing data entries, or unresponsive behavior upon resizing/scrolling through data rows/columns. 

These issues point out potential bugs in user interfaces related to displaying information on screens using HTML elements like `<button>`, `<modal>` (or similar), and `<table>`.
