Okay, so I need to optimize the given React code. Let me look at it first.

The code imports React and a component called TokenListPlaceholder. Then it exports a default object with a title and a story. The story is a function that returns the placeholder component.

Hmm, I remember that in newer versions of React, we can use arrow functions more concisely. The current DefaultStory is written as a function with return, but maybe I can convert it to an arrow function without the return statement for brevity.

Also, when exporting an object with stories in Storybook or similar libraries, sometimes you can export named stories directly using export const syntax instead of exporting an object. This might make the code cleaner.

So, instead of exporting an object with DefaultStory as a property inside stories, I can change it to export const DefaultStory = ... and set storyName there. That should work and make the code shorter.

Let me try rewriting it:

- Replace the function declaration with an arrow function.
- Remove curly braces since it's a single-line return.
- Export each story directly using export const.
- Assign storyName as a property on DefaultStory after declaration.

That should optimize the code by making it more concise without losing functionality.
</think>

import React from 'react';
import TokenListPlaceholder from './token-list-placeholder.component';

export default {
  title: 'Components/App/TokenList/TokenListPlaceholder',
};

export const DefaultStory = () => <TokenListPlaceholder />;
DefaultStory.storyName = 'Default';
